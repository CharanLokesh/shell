manual steps to follow

step1: Install httpd
yum install httpd ---> as root/root privilages

step2: chaniging default port 80 to some other port
cd /etc/httpd/conf/
vi httpd.conf ----> there you will see somewhere in the file as listen 80 and we can change it
or
sed -i 's/80/8080/' httpd.conf ----> replace 80 with 8080 directly (sed is used to replace all 80 with 8080 in the particular file) The -i flag in sed stands for "in-place" editing

step3: write custom static info for home page
edit index.html file

cd/ var/www/html
vi index.html ---> write what ever u want 

step4: start/restart httpd
systemctl restart httpd

step4: finally check the changes
curl https://localhost:8080
or check with url on browser

now we will write shellscript for this
